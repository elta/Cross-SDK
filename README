This is a OpenSurce Cross Platform SDK.

Our aim is build a user friendly Cross SDK for a Real Time GNU/Linux system
which using LLVM/Clang as default compiler, you are welcome to use and hack
this project, we can make it better together.

I'll try my best to fix all the toolchain bugs, and keep the other members
maintain their part of the SDK.

===============================================================================
GNU root FS is partly come from CLFS, IDE-plugin is writen by Dongxue-Zhang.

===============================================================================
TODO:
- Switch to LLVMLinux
- Make Clang to be the default compiler
- IDE Debugger support
- IDE Static Analyzer support
- IDE U-Boot config support
- IDE Linux config support

===============================================================================
Prerequisites:
(K)Ubuntu 12.10 AMD64 and (K)Ubuntu 12.04 AMD64 are well tested,
and you are welcome to test it on other platforms.

Just run this in your terminal:
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libsdl1.2-dev libqt4-dev g++ flex bison \
                     cmake automake gawk libtool gettext gperf dejagnu \
                     guile-2.0 autogen texinfo patch xz-utils

===============================================================================
Usage:
${TOOL}.sh ${SDK_PREFIX}
${ROOS_FS}.sh ${SDK_PREFIX}

Excample:
run
./tool-mips*el-linux.sh
to get gnu toolchain.

run
./mips64el-rootfs.sh
to get 64bit multilib gnu root fs.

run
./mips64el-linux.sh
to get 64bit & n32 linux kernel.

Notice:
It will take a huge disk space in your disk, make sure you run them in
a big partation:)
make sure you have run ./get_tarballs.sh first, if you got failed,
just run it again.

===============================================================================
The last thing, Happy Hacking:)
