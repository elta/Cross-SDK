This is a OpenSurce Cross Platform SDK.

Our aim is build a easy to use Cross SDK, you are welcome to use and hack
this project, let's make it better together.

I'll try my best to fix all the toolchain bugs, and keep the other members
maintain their part of the SDK.

===============================================================================
GNU root FS part is come from CLFS, IDE-plugin is writen by Dongxue-Zhang.

===============================================================================
TODO:
- Debugger support
- Static Analyzer support
- U-Boot config support
- Linux config support
- RTEMS support
- Bare system support

===============================================================================
Prerequisites:
(K)Ubuntu 12.10 AMD64 and (K)Ubuntu 12.04 AMD64 are well tested,
and you are welcome to test it on other platforms.

Just run this in your terminal:
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libsdl1.2-dev libqt4-dev g++ flex bison \
                     cmake automake gawk libtool gettext gperf dejagnu \
                     guile-2.0 autogen texinfo patch xz-utils

===============================================================================
Usage:
${TOOL}.sh ${SDK_PREFIX}
${ROOS_FS}.sh ${SDK_PREFIX}

Excample:
run
tool-gnu64.sh /home/jia/sdk
to get 64bit gnu toolchain.

run
mips64el-multilib-stage1.sh /home/jia/sdk
mips64el-multilib-stage2.sh /home/jia/sdk
mips64el-multilib-stage3.sh /home/jia/sdk
mips64el-multilib-stage4.sh /home/jia/sdk
to get 64bit multilib gnu root fs.

Notice:
It will take a huge disk space in your disk, make sure you run them in
a big partation:)
make sure you have run ./get_tarballs.sh first, if you got failed,
just run it again.

===============================================================================
The last thing, Happy Hacking:)
