Cross-SDK
=========


This is a OpenSource Cross Platform SDK.

Our aim is build a user friendly Cross SDK for a Real Time GNU/Linux system
which using LLVM/Clang as default compiler, you are welcome to use and hack
this project, we can make it better together.

===============================================================================
Version History:
0.9:
- Build QT-Creator Plugin with QT-Creator.
- Merge QT-Creator Plugin plugin into main tree.

0.8:
- Add OpenOCD.
- KUbuntu 13.04 well tested all of the scripts.
- KUbuntu 12.10 AMD64 no longger tested.

0.7:
- Remove busybox support, minimal-system and command-line-tools.
- Add SSH support.
- New IDE plugin support(still in develop).

0.6:
- OS X Mountain Lion well tested minimal-system now!

0.5:
- Combine ${SRC} as possible as we can, saving a huge disk space.

0.4:
- Slipt scripts.
- OS X Mountain Lion well tested command-line-tools and development-kit,
  KUbuntu 12.10 AMD64 well tested all of the scripts.

0.3:
- OS X Mountain Lion partly support, toolchain and linux kernel can be compiled,
  rootfs and busybox can not.
- Remove RTEMS, baremetal support.
- KUbuntu 12.04 AMD64 no longger tested.

0.2:
- KUbuntu 12.10 AMD64 well tested.
- Compile GNU rootfs using sysroot way.

0.1:
- KUbuntu 12.04 AMD64 well tested.

===============================================================================
TODO:
- Improve Real Time performance.
- IDE plugin such as Static Analyzer and Linux config support.
- Make Clang to be the default compiler.

===============================================================================
Prerequisites:
OS X Mountain Lion is partly suppoted, we are using Homebrew, and we need a
Case-sensitive, Journaled FS or working DMG.
You need run this in your terminal:
brew install autoconf autoconf213 automake bash-completion cmake coreutils \
             ext2fuse fuse4x fuse4x-kext gawk gettext glib gnu-getopt gnu-sed \
             libelf libffi libpng libtool p7zip pixman pkg-config qt texinfo \
             unrar wget xz zlib

(K)Ubuntu 13.04 AMD64 are well tested.
You need run this in your terminal:
sudo apt-get install autogen automake bison cmake dejagnu flex g++ gawk \
                     gettext gperf guile-2.0 libgtk2.0-dev libncurses5-dev \
                     libqt4-dev libtool libvte-dev patch texinfo xz-utils

You are welcome to test it on other platforms.

===============================================================================
Usage:
${SCRIPT}.sh

Example:
run
./mipsel-development-kit.sh
to get a SDK.

run
./mipsel-system.sh
to get gnu root fs.

If you were to use qemu with network:
sudo tunctl -t qemutap
sudo ifconfig qemutap 10.0.0.1
sudo qemu-system-mipsel -kernel vmlinux-32 -hda mipsel-rootfs.img -append "root=/dev/hda" -nographic  -net nic -net tap,ifname=qemutap,script=no,downscript=no -M malta

Notice:
It will take a lot of space in your disk, make sure you run them in a big
partation:)
Make sure you have run ./get-sources.sh first, if you got failed,
just run it again.
Run ./cleanup.sh to free your disk space.

===============================================================================
GNU root FS is partly come from CLFS.

===============================================================================
The last thing, Happy Hacking:)
