This is a OpenSource Cross Platform SDK.

Our aim is build a user friendly Cross SDK for a Real Time GNU/Linux system
which using LLVM/Clang as default compiler, you are welcome to use and hack
this project, we can make it better together.

I'll try my best to fix all the toolchain bugs, and keep the other members
maintain their part of the SDK.

===============================================================================
Version History:
0.1:
- KUbuntu 12.04 AMD64 well tested.

0.2:
- KUbuntu 12.10 AMD64 well tested.
- Compile GNU rootfs using sysroot way.

0.3:
- OS X 10.8.2 and KUbuntu 12.10 AMD64 well tested.
- Remove RTEMS, baremetal support.

===============================================================================
TODO:
- Switch to LLVMLinux
- Make Clang to be the default compiler
- IDE Debugger support
- IDE Static Analyzer support
- IDE U-Boot config support
- IDE Linux config support

===============================================================================
Prerequisites:
OS X 10.8.2 is well tested, we are using Homebrew, and we need a Case-sensitive,
Journaled FS or working DMG.
You need run this in your terminal:
brew install autoconf gettext libpng pkg-config xz automake glib libtool qt \
             zlib bash-completion gnu-getopt macvim quilt coreutils gnu-sed \
             texinfo libelf p7zip unrar libffi pixman wget

(K)Ubuntu 12.10 AMD64 and (K)Ubuntu 12.04 AMD64 are well tested.
You need run this in your terminal:
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libsdl1.2-dev libqt4-dev g++ flex bison \
                     cmake automake gawk libtool gettext gperf dejagnu \
                     guile-2.0 autogen texinfo patch xz-utils

You are welcome to test it on other platforms.

===============================================================================
Usage:
${TOOL}.sh
${ROOS_FS}.sh

Example:
run
./tool-mips-linux.sh
to get gnu toolchain.

run
./mips64el-rootfs.sh
to get 64bit multilib gnu root fs.

run
./mips64el-linux.sh
to get 64bit & n32 linux kernel.

Notice:
It will take a lot of space in your disk, make sure you run them in a big
partation:)
Make sure you have run ./get_tarballs.sh first, if you got failed,
just run it again.
Run ./cleanup to free your disk space.

===============================================================================
GNU root FS is partly come from CLFS, IDE-plugin is writen by Dongxue-Zhang.

The last thing, Happy Hacking:)
